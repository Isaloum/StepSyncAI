                explanation: `Imagine you want to build with LEGO blocks, but you don't have enough blocks at home.
EC2 is like going to a LEGO store where you can rent as many blocks as you need!

When you need a computer to run your programs, instead of buying a big expensive computer,
you can "rent" one from Amazon's huge warehouse of computers. You can:
- Make it bigger when you need more power (like getting more LEGO blocks)
- Make it smaller when you don't need as much
- Turn it off when you're done (and stop paying for it!)
- Choose different types for different jobs
