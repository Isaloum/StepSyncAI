I'm excited to announce the launch of StepSyncAI on Product Hunt! 🎉

As someone who's worked in healthcare IT, I've seen how personal health data can be misused. So I built a wellness tracker that:

🔒 Keeps 100% of your data LOCAL (no servers, no tracking)
💊 Validates medication dosages and checks drug interactions
📊 Visualizes wellness trends with beautiful charts
📱 Works offline as a Progressive Web App
🆓 Is completely free and open source

Built for people who care about mental health, medication adherence, sleep quality, and fitness—but don't want to trust another company with their most personal data.

Would love your support! Check it out and leave feedback:

**Reddit Post** (r/SideProject):
```
Title: [Show] StepSyncAI - Privacy-first health tracker (100% local, no servers)

I built a wellness tracking app because I was tired of health apps that require accounts and send data to the cloud.

**Features:**
- Track mood, medications, sleep, and exercise
- 150+ medications with dosage validation
- 65+ drug interaction warnings
- 7-day wellness trends chart
- Works offline (PWA)
- 100% local storage (data never sent to servers)

**Tech:**
- Vanilla JavaScript (no framework)
- Chart.js for viz
- PWA with service worker
- 1,927 automated tests

**Why I built it:**
Had a family member with chronic illness who needed to track multiple medications. Existing apps either charged money, had terrible UX, or required cloud accounts. Built this as a privacy-first alternative.

**Open source:** [GitHub link]
**Live demo:** [App link]
**Just launched on Product Hunt:** [PH link]

Would love feedback from the community! What features would you want to see next?

## Common Product Hunt Questions (Prepare Answers)

### Q: "How does it make money if it's free?"
**A:** It doesn't! This is a passion project to prove privacy-first health tracking is possible. No ads, no premium tiers. I might accept donations in the future, but the core will always be free.

### Q: "Why not use Firebase or Supabase for sync?"
**A:** Privacy. Any backend introduces a server that can be hacked, subpoenaed, or sold. Local-only ensures YOUR data stays YOURS. Optional self-hosted sync is on the roadmap.

### Q: "What about HIPAA compliance?"
**A:** StepSyncAI isn't a HIPAA-covered entity (it's a personal tool, not a healthcare provider). Your data never touches a server, so HIPAA doesn't apply. If you share exports with your doctor, their system must be HIPAA-compliant.

### Q: "Can I import data from Apple Health / Google Fit?"
**A:** Not yet, but wearable integration is planned. For now, you can manually log data. Future versions will support API integration.

### Q: "Why vanilla JavaScript instead of React?"
**A:** Zero dependencies (except Chart.js), instant loading, simple deployment, easy auditing. The codebase is small enough that vanilla JS is actually simpler than managing a framework.

### Q: "Is there an iOS/Android app?"
**A:** It's a PWA (Progressive Web App), so you can install it like a native app on both platforms. Native app wrappers (React Native) are on the roadmap.

## Hunter vs. Maker

**Hunter**: The person who submits the product (can be yourself or someone with a large PH following)

**Maker**: The creator (you)

**Recommendation**: 
- **Self-hunt** (submit it yourself) if you have an engaged network
- **Ask a hunter** with 1,000+ followers if you want more initial visibility
- Popular hunters: Ryan Hoover (founder), Chris Messina, etc.

Most successful launches are self-hunted with genuine community engagement.
